# Healthcare Readmission AI

This project predicts hospital readmission risk for diabetic patients using machine learning.  
It demonstrates an **end-to-end ML pipeline** including:

- 📊 Data cleaning & preprocessing (ETL)  
- 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis & visualization  
- 🤖 Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- 📈 Model evaluation (ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, SHAP interpretability)  
- 🌐 Deployment as an interactive Streamlit app  

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Streamlit
- Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces (free deployment)

## Dataset
This project uses the **Diabetes 130-US Hospitals** dataset, containing over 100K patient records from 130 U.S. hospitals (1999–2008).
